  \title An Overview of Qt's Examples
  \brief A short guide to the different categories of examples included with Qt.
  \ingroup howto

  Qt is supplied with a variety of examples that cover almost every aspect
  of development. These examples are ordered by functional area, but many
  examples often use features from many parts of Qt to highlight one area
  in particular.

  This document provides a brief overview of each example category and
  provides links to the more formal \l{Qt Examples}{list of examples}.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Widgets}{Widgets}

  \l{Qt Examples#Widgets}{\inlineimage widget-examples.png
  }

  Qt comes with a large range of standard widgets that users of modern
  applications have come to expect.

  You can also develop your own custom widgets and controls, and use them
  alongside standard widgets.

  It is even possible to provide custom styles and themes for widgets that can
  be used to change the appearance of standard widgets and appropriately
  written custom widgets.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Dialogs}{Dialogs}

  \l{Qt Examples#Dialogs}{\inlineimage dialog-examples.png
  }

  Qt includes standard dialogs for many common operations, such as file
  selection, printing, and color selection.

  Custom dialogs can also be created for specialized modal or modeless
  interactions with users.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Main Windows}{Main Windows}

  \l{Qt Examples#Main Windows}{\inlineimage mainwindow-examples.png
  }

  All the standard features of application main windows are provided by Qt.

  Main windows can have pull down menus, tool bars, and dock windows. These
  separate forms of user input are unified in an integrated action system that
  also supports keyboard shortcuts and accelerator keys in menu items.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Layouts}{Layouts}

  \l{Qt Examples#Layouts}{\inlineimage layout-examples.png
  }

  Qt uses a layout-based approach to widget management. Widgets are arranged in
  the optimal positions in windows based on simple layout rules, leading to a
  consistent look and feel.

  Custom layouts can be used to provide more control over the positions and
  sizes of child widgets.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Painting}{Painting}

  \l{Qt Examples#Painting}{\inlineimage painting-examples.png
  }

  Qt's painting system is able to render vector graphics, images, and outline
  font-based text with sub-pixel accuracy accuracy using anti-aliasing to
  improve rendering quality.

  These examples show the most common techniques that are used when painting
  with Qt, from basic concepts such as drawing simple primitives to the use of
  transformations.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Item Views}{Item Views}

  \l{Qt Examples#Item Views}{\inlineimage itemview-examples.png
  }

  Item views are widgets that typically display data sets. Qt 4's model/view
  framework lets you handle large data sets by separating the underlying data
  from the way it is represented to the user, and provides support for
  customized rendering through the use of delegates.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Graphics View}{Graphics View}

  MIME-based system that enables applications to send data to each other in the
  most appropriate formats.

  Drag and drop can also be implemented for internal use by applications.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Threads}{Threads}

  \l{Qt Examples#Threads}{\inlineimage thread-examples.png
  }

  Qt 4 makes it easier than ever to write multithreaded applications. More
  classes have been made usable from non-GUI threads, and the signals and slots
  mechanism can now be used to communicate between threads.

  Additionally, it is now possible to move objects between threads.

  \section1 \l{Qt Examples#Concurrent Programming}{Concurrent Programming}
