    \title Qt Demonstrations
    \brief Information about the demonstration programs provided with Qt.
    \ingroup howto

    This is the list of demonstrations in Qt's \c demos directory.
    These are larger and more complicated programs than the
    \l{Qt Examples} and are used to highlight certain features of
    Qt. You can launch any of these programs from the
    \l{Examples and Demos Launcher} application.

    If you are new to Qt, and want to start developing applications,
    you should probably start by going through the \l{Tutorials}.

    \section1 Painting

    \list
    \o \l{demos/composition}{Composition Modes} demonstrates the range of
       composition modes available with Qt.

       possible with a vector-oriented paint engine.
    \o \l{demos/gradients}{Gradients} shows the different types of gradients
       that are available in Qt.
    \o \l{demos/pathstroke}{Path Stroking} shows Qt's built-in dash patterns
