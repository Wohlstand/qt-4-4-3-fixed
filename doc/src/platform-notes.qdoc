    \target AIX
    \section1 AIX - 5.1 or later

    Qt has been built on a range of versions from 5.1 upwards, using both
    the \l{Compiler Notes#IBM xlC (AIX)}{AIX} and 
    \l{Compiler Notes#GCC}{GCC} compilers.

    \table
    \header \o Compiler \o Notes
    \row    \o xlC
    \o If Qt is built correctly but all symbols are reported to be missing
    when you link an application, your makeC++SharedLib script might be out
    of date. Make sure you have the latest version from the
    \l{http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/vacpp/support/}{IBM website}.
    \row    \o GCC
    \o We have tested Qt 4 successfully with GCC version 3.3 and above.
    Some versions of GCC may fail to link Qt with a "TOC overflow" message.
    Fix this by upgrading to the latest maintenance release of the dynamic
    linker. On AIX this is bos.rte.bind_cmds.4.1.5.3.
    Some versions of GCC may fail to build Qt with STL and large-file support
    enabled, due to
    \l{http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9551}{a bug in GCC}.
    Fix this by upgrading to the latest maintenance release of the compiler.
    It is also possible to work around this problem by running configure with
    either \c{-no-stl} or \c{-no-largefile}.
    \endtable

    \target FreeBSD
    \section1 FreeBSD - 6.0-RELEASE

    The system compiler on FreeBSD 4.x is gcc 2.95.4, which is not
    officially supported by Qt 4. We develop using and recommend
    ports/lang/gcc34. You will need to run configure with the
    \c{-platform freebsd-g++34} arguments. Optionally, you may use
    ports/lang/icc.

    The system compiler on FreeBSD 5.x and 6.x is gcc 3.4.4, which is
    officially supported by Qt. You do not need to add any special
    arguments when running configure. Optionally, you may use ports/lang/icc.

    Note that we do not actively test FreeBSD 4.x and 5.x. Our developers
    migrated to 6.x after the Qt 4 launch. FreeBSD-CURRENT is not supported.

    \target HP-UX
    \section1 HP-UX

    Qt supports HP-UX on both PA-RISC and the Itanium (IA64) architectures.

    \section2 PA-RISC - B.11.11 or later

    You can configure Qt for aCC in 32 and 64 bit mode (hpux-acc-64 or
    hpux-acc-32), or gcc in 32 bit mode (hpux-g++).  The default platform is
    hpux-acc-32. The minimum required version for aCC (HP ANSI C++) on PA-RISC
    is A.03.57. The supported gcc compiler is gcc 3.4.3.

    \section2 Itanium - B.11.23 or later

    You can configure Qt for aCC in 32 and 64 bit mode (hpuxi-acc-64 or
    hpuxi-acc-32). gcc is currently unsupported.  The default platform is
    hpuxi-acc-64. The minimum required version for aCC (HP ANSI C++) on
    Itanium is A.06.12.

    \section2 OpenGL Support

    Qt's \l{QtOpenGL}{OpenGL} module requires GLX 1.3 or later to be installed.
    This is available for HP-UX 11i - see the
    \l{http://docs.hp.com/en/5992-2331/ch04s02.html}{Graphics and Technical Computing Software}
    section of the release notes for more information.

    \target IRIX
    \section1 IRIX - 6.5.x

    Unpackaging and IRIX tar:
    Because of long filenames some files will be cut off incorrectly with IRIX
    tar. Please use GNU tar to unpack Qt packages.

    \section1 Linux

    There are no known problems with using Qt on production versions of
    Linux/x86, Linux/ppc, Linux/amd64 and Linux/ia64 (including Altix(R)).
    We do our Unix development mainly on Linux/x86.

    For the gcc/g++ compiler, please also see the relevant
    \l{Compiler Notes#GCC}{compiler page}.

    \section2 Installation problems

    See also the
    \l{http://www.trolltech.com/developer/faqs/Qt/installation}{Installation FAQ}.

    If you experience problems when installing new Qt Open Source Edition
    versions, try to use the Qt Open Source Edition archives (e.g. RPM)
    provided by your Linux provider. If you need to install the source (.tgz)
    archive, be aware that you will probably end up with two different
    versions of the Qt library installed on your system, which will probably
    lead to link errors, like this:
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 0
    Fix this by removing the old version of the library.

    If you have problems installing a Qt Open Source Edition Linux archive
    (e.g. RPM), please consult your Linux provider (who made it), not us.

    Some RPM versions have problems installing some of the Qt RPM archives
    where installation stops with an error message warning about a
    "Failed Dependency". Use the \c{--nodeps} option to \c rpm to workaround
    this problem.

    \target Solaris
    \section1 Solaris - 9 or later

    \section2 CC on Solaris

    Be sure to check our \l{Compiler Notes#Sun Studio}{Forte Developer / Sun Studio}
    notes.

    \section2 GCC on Solaris

    Be sure to check the installation notes for
    \l{http://gcc.gnu.org/install/specific.html#x-x-solaris2}{GCC on Solaris}.
    Do not use GCC with Sun's assembler/linker, this will result in link-time
    errors in shared libraries. Use GNU binutils instead. 

    GCC 3.2.* is known to miscompile Qt due to an optimizer bug that will
    cause the resulting binaries to hang.

    GCC gives compilation error
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 1
    on systems with old X11 header files. This is fixed by patches
    \l{http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=urn:cds:docid:1-21-108652}{108652-24}
    on Solaris 8,
    \l{http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=urn:cds:docid:1-21-108376}{108376-21}
    on Solaris 7, and
    \l{http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=urn:cds:docid:1-21-105633}{105633-56}
    on Solaris 2.6.

    \section2 Solaris 2.6

    A crash on resize of widgets example has been reported, but not reproduced.
    Patch \l{http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=urn:cds:docid:1-21-105633}{105633-21}
    is reported to solve the problem. We are interested in hearing more details
    from anyone who can reproduce and track this problem closer.

    \title Platform Notes - Windows

    This page contains information about the Windows platforms Qt is currently
    known to run on, with links to platform-specific notes. More information
    about the combinations of platforms and compilers supported by Qt can be
    found on the \l{Supported Platforms} page.

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Windows Vista

    Known issues for Qt on Vista will be listed here.

    As of Qt 4.2.0 no Vista-specific issues are known.

    \target Windows NT
    \section1 Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Windows NT

    \section2 Installation location

    Installing Qt into a directory with spaces, e.g. C:\\Program Files, may
    cause linker errors like the following:
    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 2

    Install Qt into a subdirectory without spaces to avoid this problem.

    \section2 AccelGALAXY graphic card

    When you use a NT 4.0 machine with the driver number
    4,00,1381,1000,021,4.0.0 there is a problem with drag an drop and icons.
    The computer freezes, and you have to reset. The problem disappears with
    the newest version of the driver, available at
    \l{http://www.es.com/}{www.es.com}.

    \section2 Possible GL conflict

    There is a known issue with running Microsoft NetMeeting, Lotus SameTime
    and other applications that require screen grabbing while direct
    rendering is enabled. Other GL-applications may not work as expected,
    unless direct rendering is disabled.

    \section1 Windows 98 and Me

    As for \l{#Windows NT}{Windows NT}, with the following exceptions:

    \section2 Unicode support

    Since Windows 98 does not implement much Unicode, Qt's Unicode support
    on Windows 98 is lacking. Note that Qt attempts to hide these
    differences - application programs can see that the fonts available are
    rather incomplete, but there is generally no need for programs to care.
    With other toolkits such as MFC, you often need to recompile. With Qt,
    your programs simply detect and use the capabilities of the Windows
    version they run on.

    \section2 COMCTL32 problems

    If you are experiencing a crash in comctl32.dll after debugging your Qt
    application then this is not a problem with Qt, see MSDN Knowledge Base
    article
    \l{http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q255/6/07.ASP}{Q255607}
    for more information.

    \page platform-notes-mac.html
    \title Platform Notes - Mac OS X

    This page contains information about the Mac OS X versions Qt is currently
    known to run on, with links to platform-specific notes. More information
    about the combinations of platforms and compilers supported by Qt can be
    found on the \l{Supported Platforms} page.

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 General Information

    Qt 4.3 has been tested to run on Mac OS X 10.3.9 and up. See notes on
    the binary package for more information.

    Qt 4.1 has been tested to run on Mac OS X 10.2.8 and up. Qt 4.1.4 is the
    last release to work with Mac OS X 10.2.

    \section2 Required GCC version

    Qt can be compiled with GCC 3.3 and above. However, the version of
    GCC 3.3 that is included with Xcode Tools 1.5 generates incorrect code
    for Qt 4.1.3. You need the November 2004 GCC 3.3 updater,
    \l{http://connect.apple.com}{available from Apple}.

    \section2 Binary Package

    The binary package requires that you have your .qt-license file in your
    home directory. Installer.app cannot complete without a valid .qt-license
    file. Evaluation users of Qt will have information about how to create
    this file in the email they receive.

    The binary package was built on Mac OS X 10.4 with Xcode Tools 2.1
    (gcc 4.0.0) for Qt 4.1.0, Xcode Tools 2.2 (gcc 4.0.1) for Qt 4.1.1-4.1.4
    and Xcode Tools 2.3 for 4.2.0. It will only link executables built
    against 10.4 (or a 10.4 SDK). You should be able to run applications
    linked against these frameworks on Mac OS X 10.3.9 and Mac OS X 10.4+.
    If you require a different configuration, you will have to use the
    source package and build with GCC 3.3.

    \section2 Mac OS X on Intel hardware

    Qt 4 fully supports both the Intel and PowerPC architectures on the Mac.
    As of Qt 4.1 it is possible to support the Intel architecture by
    creating Universal Binaries with qmake. As of Qt 4.1 it is possible to
    build Qt as a set of universal binaries and frameworks from configure by
    adding these extra flags:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 3

    If you are building on Intel hardware you can omit the sdk parameter, but
    PowerPC hardware requires it.

    You can also generate universal binaries using qmake. Simply add these
    lines to your .pro file:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 4

    \section2 Build Issues

    If Qt does not build upon executing make, and fails with an error message
    such as

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 5

    this could be an indication you have upgraded your version of Mac OS X
    (e.g. 10.3 to 10.4), without upgrading your Developer Tools (Xcode Tools).
    These must match in order to successfully compile files.

    Please be sure to upgrade both simultaneously. If problems still occur,
    contact support.

    \section2 Fink

    If you have installed the Qt for X11 package from Fink (http://fink.sf.net),
    it will set the QMAKESPEC environment variable to darwin-g++. This will
    cause problems when you build the Qt for Mac OS X package. To fix this, simply
    unset your QMAKESPEC or set it to macx-g++ before you run configure.
    You need to have a fresh Qt distribution (make confclean).

    \section2 MySQL and Mac OS X

    There seems to be a issue when both -prebind and -multi_module are
    defined when linking static C libraries into dynamic library. If you
    get the following error message when linking Qt:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_platform-notes.qdoc 6

    re-link Qt using -single_module. This is only a problem when building the
    MySQL driver into Qt. It does not affect plugins or static builds.

    \section2 Qt and Precompiled Headers (PCH)

    Starting with Qt 3.3.0 it is possible to use precompiled headers. They
    are not enabled by default as it appears that some versions of Apple's
    GCC and make have problems with this feature. If you want to use
    precompiled headers when building the Qt source package, specify the
    -pch option to configure. If, while using precompiled headers, you
    encounter an internal compile error, try removing the -include header
    statement from the compile line and trying again. If this solves the
    problem, it probably is a good idea to turn off precompiled headers.
    Also, consider filing a bug report with Apple so that they can
    improve support for this feature.

    \title Supported Platforms
    \brief The platforms supported by Nokia for Qt.
    \ingroup platform-notes

    Qt is supported on a variety of 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and can
    usually be built on each platform with GCC, a vendor-supplied compiler, or
    a third party compiler. Although Qt may be built on a range of platform-compiler
    combinations, only a subset of these are actively supported by Nokia:

    \section1 Actively Supported Platforms
