    Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt

    _STANDALONE_ defined.
    \i Changed behavior in \c{ftraster.c} to follow X polygon filling
    rules.
    \i Implemented support in \c{ftraster.c} for winding / odd even
    polygon fill rules.
    \i Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in \c{ftraster.c}.
    \i Renamed \c{ftraster.h} as \c{qblackraster_p.h}.
